# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the churn dataset found in [https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling]. I have createdd a gist of this dataset at
[https://gist.github.com/arjunrao796123/7c30f2b6d4a3a3746b0154260a7f46e8]. The dataset consists of 10000 data points which reprsesnt customers for a company. Each data point consists of details of the customer like CreditScore, Geography, Age,  Gender etc.. 


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

The image shows a compariosn between Age and Creditscore. The orange color indicates the customer has churned and the blue dot indicates that the customer has not churned.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which factors most influence churning of a customer?
 * Which country is responsible for less churning? Is there a specific reason for this?
 * Does the gender and salry affect churning of a customer?

## Sketches


## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
