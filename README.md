# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the churn dataset found in [https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling]. I have createdd a gist of this dataset at
[https://gist.github.com/arjunrao796123/7c30f2b6d4a3a3746b0154260a7f46e8]. The dataset consists of 10000 data points which reprsesnt customers for a company. Each data point consists of details of the customer like CreditScore, Geography, Age,  Gender etc.. 


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data.

The image shows a compariosn between Age and Creditscore. The orange color indicates the customer has churned and the blue dot indicates that the customer has not churned.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Which factors most influence churning of a customer?
 * Which country is responsible for less churning? Is there a specific reason for this?
 * Does the gender and salry affect churning of a customer?

## Sketches
Here are a couple of sketeches
This image is a depiction of the credit score vs salary. We can study how churn is affected here and how these factors influence each other.

This image is a depiction of gender vs salary. We can check if the customers are paid equally and on what basis a cusotmer of a certain gender churns.

## Open Questions
There is a lot of data and I hope to make it clean visually. How can I scale my data to make it look clean?
