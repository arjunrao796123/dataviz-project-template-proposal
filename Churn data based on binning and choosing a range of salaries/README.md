A visualization constructed using the [vega-lite-api](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api/).

The data shown here comes from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shubh0799/churn-modelling), via [Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arjunrao796123/7c30f2b6d4a3a3746b0154260a7f46e8/raw/733351a9f0e58e194bfe4d6c21253cdf186c7b90/Churn_data.csv).

I took help from https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/interaction?collection=@uwdata/visualization-curriculum.

You can select a range of salaries on the top graph to view that in the below graph.
I have binned the salaries into 50 bins.
